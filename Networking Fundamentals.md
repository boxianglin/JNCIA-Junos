What are the benefits of IPv6?
- IPv6 reduces admistrative overhead using stateless address autoconfiguration for hosts
- IPv6 supports a greater level of security by integrating features that were optional add-ons in IPv4
---

**Which of these are true about Layer 2 broadcast frames? (choose two)**
1. - [x] layer 2 broadcast frames are processed by all devices on the same VLAN
2. layer 2 broadcast frames are relayed by routers to all connected VLANs 
3. layer 2 broadcast frames are discarded by routers that connect to multipl VLANs
4. - [x] layer 2 broadcast frames are relayed by switches to devices on the same VLAN

`same VLAN is the key, as layer 2 dont deal with cross VLANs, hint: Broadcast MAC address`
